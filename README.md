# ILESLA_Neuro_Stats_Project
The repository for all things to do with the ILESLA Stats Project.

Project Description:
Parkinson’s disease involves disrupted communication between the neurotransmitters dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh). 
This imbalance has long been thought to contribute to the motor symptoms of the disease, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
In this project, you will work with ex vivo recordings from mouse brain slices that differ in their vulnerability to parkinsonian degeneration.
A fluorescent sensor, GRABACh3.0, emits brief flashes of light whenever ACh is detected, providing a window into local neural activity.
Your task is to optimise an analysis pipeline to detect these short, low-signal-to-noise ACh release events and quantify how each event 
spreads across space and time. You will also compare data collected before and after drug treatment with CGP-78608, which may alter ACh 
release patterns. This project bridges neuroscience and data science, combining image processing and signal extraction to explore how 
neurotransmitters propagate through brain tissue and how drugs can reshape their activity patterns.

Question: To optimise an event-detection pipeline that maps spontaneous neural activity across space and time in brain tissue
